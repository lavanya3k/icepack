    "In this demo we'll study the fastest glacier on earth: Jakobshavn Isbrae, or Sermeq Kujalleq if you prefer the Greenlandic name.\n",
    "We'll tread over some familiar territory, albeit in an unfamiliar way.\n",
    "To initialize the simulation, we'll estimate the friction coefficient using the shallow stream equations.\n",
    "But for the fact that we're using a slightly more sophisticated physics model and inferring the friction instead of the rheology, this should all be familiar from demo \\#4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll lift everything up into 3D and study how heat is transported through a glacier.\n",
    "The physical effect that we want to demonstrate is how strain heating softens the margins.\n",
    "The field of interest here is the *internal energy density* $E$, which has units of MPa / m${}^3$.\n",
    "The internal energy density encompasses both the ice temperature and the latent heat stored in meltwater.\n",
    "For a given temperature $T$ and meltwater fraction $f$, the internal energy density is\n",
    "$$E = \\rho (c_pT + Lf)$$\n",
    "where $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity of ice at constant pressure and $L$ is the latent heat of melting.\n",
    "An englacial meltwater fraction of 0.33% is on the high side.\n",
    "The energy density can be a much more convenient field to work with than the temperature because we don't have to track the moving cold-temperate transition surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal energy is transported by two mechanisms: advection and vertical diffusion.\n",
    "Horizontal diffusion is completely negligible.\n",
    "The main sources of thermal energy are geothermal heating from the ice base, exchange of heat with the atmosphere at the ice surface, and strain heating from within.\n",
    "Putting all this together, the equations of heat transport are:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot Eu - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\alpha\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial z} = \\tau : \\dot\\varepsilon,$$\n",
    "with the boundary condition\n",

    "The heat generated at the ice base from sliding is a key input to the thermal transport equation, but we have no a priori measurements of sliding friction.\n",
    "We can estimate a sensible value using inverse methods, much like we did for the rheology of the Larsen Ice Shelf.\n",
    "Unfortunately, for grounded glaciers things get really circular really quick -- we need a basal friction to estimate temperature, but we need a temperature to estimate basal friction.\n",
